# SendNotificationToWebWithFirebase

It is a simple project that is able send firebase notifications from .NetCore backend side.

It has Frontend side which is written in ReactJs.

Frontend side listens all firebase notifications which is coming from backend. It provides to show to users, too.

I used FirebaseAdmin package to send firebase notifications on .net core side. on ReactJs or frontend side, I used serviceWorker and listened all notifications.
